# Contributing

### Branches
- A branch name should begin with the issue number, and have short name (2-4 words). New features or fixes should be based off of the `master` branch.
  - `git checkout -b 123-short-name master`

### Testing
When making changes or adding a new feature, to ensure the feature works correctly or the changes made have not broken the code then you can do unit testing using the behave framework and gherkin scenarios.
*[Behave Framework Docs](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

To begin testing your scenarios
- do `pipenv install`
- run `pipenv run behave`
- if it passes
  - commit and push your branch
  - checkout develop and merge your branch
  - push the develop branch
  - open a pull request for your branch in master
- if it fails
  - fix the problem so all tests pass

#### Configuring CircleCI
Changes to the CircleCI config can be made at `/.circleci/config.yml`

To test your config changes locally:
1. Open Terminal and cd to telegram-dogecoin repository
2. `$ cd .circleci`
3. Go to circleci.com and [get a new API token](https://circleci.com/account/api) (for `CIRCLE_TOKEN`)
4. `$ git log`
5. Copy the commit hash (for `COMMIT_HASH`)
6. Copy the branch name (for `BRANCH_URL`)
7. Set environment variables in Terminal:
    ```
    $ export CIRCLE_TOKEN=<api token>
    $ export COMMIT_HASH=<commit hash>
    $ export BRANCH_URL=https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/peakshift/telegram-dogecoin/tree/<branch name>
    ```
8. Execute build script:  `$ ./run-build-locally.sh`
9. Go to `https://circleci.com/gh/peakshift/telegram-dogecoin/tree/<branch name>` and confirm tests are running. 

### Pushing Changes
1. Open Terminal.
2. `git pull`
3. `git add file_name.py`
4. `git commit -m "type(component): subject line"`
5. `git push origin 123-short-name `

### Commit Messages

*We follow the [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) so that we can generate changelogs and have a clean commit history â€” see Pushing Changes #3 for an example commit.*

- Type, for your commit message commiting you should select a type from this list below:
  - feat: a new features
  - fix: a bug fix
  - docs: documentation only changes
  - style: changes that do not affect the menaing of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
  - pref: a code change that improves performance
  - test: adding missing tests
  - chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- Components, represent the larger feature / scope of the change
- Subject line, use the imperative form of a verb
  - GOOD "add contributing guidelines"
  - BAD "adding contribuing guidelines"
